### Adding user siRNA controls to daughter plates: 
- Thaw daughter plates of the EpiGen and NucEnv libraries
	+HT00009, HT00012, HT00015, HT00018, HT00021, HT00027, HT00030, HT00030
- spin them (4000RPM for 4 minutes)-
- Unseal plates -
- Dispense 2.4 ul of 5 uM siRNA controls into columns 23 and 24 of the 384 well daughter plates.  Final concentration is 0.4 uM siRNA.
- Reseal with Aluma Seal
- Freeze at -80C

Issues:

- Varispan Zmotor4 failed and dropped to the deck, after 3rd set of siRNA controls (LMNB2) were dispensed onto plate HT00018.  Thus, 
- HT00009, HT00012, HT00015 all have siRNA controls added to columns 23 and 24.
- HT00021, HT00027, HT00030, HT00030 do not have siRNA controls added.

### Finish adding user siRNA controls to remaining daughter plates

- Thaw daughter plates of the EpiGen and NucEnv libraries
	+HT00009, HT00012, HT00015, HT00018, HT00021, HT00027, HT00030, HT00030
- spin them (4000RPM for 4 minutes)-
- Unseal plates
- Dispense 2.4 ul of 5 uM siRNA controls into columns 23 and 24 of the 384 well daughter plates.
- spin them to remove air bubbles (4000RPM for 4 minutes)
- Once spotting of imaging plates are completed, seal plates with Aluma Seal.
- Freeze at -80C.

### Spot 2 ul of siRNA (0.8 uM) onto Ultra Cell Carrier PE imagining plates.

-Spot three image plates per daughter plate.
-Plates HTIF0034 to HTIF0057.
-Air dry image plates for 4 hours in tissue culture hood.
-Seal with Aluma Seal.
-Gave one set of plates (replicate plate 1, both libraries) to Pedja.
-Store remaining plates at -20C.
